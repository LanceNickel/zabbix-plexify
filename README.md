# Plexify Zabbix
This theme does not deviate too far from the normal "Zabbix Blue" theme. If you are anything like me, you agree that IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono are the best UI fonts there are. I created this theme to change the UI fonts to IBM Plex, and also made a few small improvements along the way.

Currently there is only a light variant of the theme, but adapting it for dark shouldn't be anything more than changing which base styles this theme imports.

## Installation instructions
#### Requirements:
- Zabbix 6.2
- Root/super user access to your Zabbix Frontend server via SSH
- Permission to do this :)
